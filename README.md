## Engage Tech Test

The code provided here is designed to be a first attempt at creating a blog portal. Users should be able to log in. Users should be able to view all posts without being authenticated and create a post when they are authenticated.
There is no requirement for log out, edit/delete post. 

User login is test@test.com / password.

The code has been written in such a way that there are a number of issues with it.

This tech test is split into multiple sections: 


### Code review/analysis (15 minutes)

Please review the code provided, provide a short bullet pointed written analysis. Imagine you are receiving a pull request from a very junior member of the team. 
The code you need to focus on is the code that is created from the above requirements i.e. leftover boilerplate code from Laravel is no real concern. Also please put very little focus on the blade files as very little love went into creating them.


### Make a few fixes (30 minutes)

Depending on how long it would take please make a few fixes to the above code implementing best practices using the list of issues you have created, preferably prioritising what you would consider to be the highest impact issues.


### Add a new feature (1 hour)

We have decided to take a more SPA centric approach to this blog website and as such we need the blog index and blog single endpoints to change into an API that can be consumed by a React frontend.
